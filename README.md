# ESP32 FM Radio

### What is the purpose of the project
This project aims to use an ESP32 board to listen to FM radio stations and play music via the board's integrated Bluetooth module. It also features a sleek GUI on an OLED display!

### The idea
Iâ€™ve seen many radios at rural market stalls and wanted to create my own to see if I could make something better.

### Why I think this project is useful
I want to learn and create something I can use at home. Hopefully, others will also find it useful.
